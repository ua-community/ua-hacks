Hello! and welcome to this week’s release notes for tldraw. We’ve been hard at work preparing for tldraw’s re-launch (more on that in a few days), so expect some small changes while we work on the big ones.

## What’s new

You can now open .tldr files created with the original tldraw on beta.tldraw.com.

On tldraw.com, save a project as a .tldr file from the menu ( **File > Save As…**).

Next, open this .tldr file on beta.tldraw.com—either from the menu ( **File > Open File**) or by **dropping the file** onto the page. (That’s new too this week, dropping files onto the editor to open them.)

Your project should be migrated safely over to the new version.

Please let us know if you find any bugs or unexpected changes! Also note that this feature only works one way—you can’t open files that were created in tldraw’s new version (beta.tldraw.com) on tldraw’s old version tldraw.com).

## Improvements

We can’t go a week without improving **freehand lines**! They now do a better job at handling both hard and soft corners. Geometric shapes are now more smooth all the way round.

In toggle-able menu items, we’ve added empty checkboxes to better indicate which menu items can be toggled.

Last week we added a better system for hiding shapes that are off-screen. We’ve made some improvements so that when you pan around the screen, shapes will “pop in” more quickly.

## Fixes and Other Small Things

- Fixed a text label’s wrapping not always matching a shape’s width.
- Fixed an issue that meant arrow labels would sometimes get cut off when you exported them
- Fixed a bug where shapes wouldn’t always ‘pop in’ when loading a file.
- Fixed invalid tldraw URLs being accepted for Embed shapes.
- Pattern fills no longer flash when loading.
- Fixed opening .tldr files on iPad.
- Fixed some context menu items not being in the right place.
- Fixed disabled context menu items sometimes not appearing as disabled.
- Fixed Github link.
