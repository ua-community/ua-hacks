Welcome to this week’s release notes for [tldraw](https://beta.tldraw.com)—and on a Thursday, too. These should be pretty short and sweet, as we have a big one in the oven for next week.

By the way, have you tried [together.tldraw.com](https://together.tldraw.com/), our infinitely scrolling drawing-only chatroom? You never know who you’ll meet.

## What’s new

You can now share a **read-only** link to your project. There are now two links to any room. The regular link will allow anyone with the link to see live changes _and_ edit the shared project. The special read-only link will allow anyone to see those live changes but _not_ be able to make any changes themselves. Very handy for presentations and demos.

Speaking of multiplayer rooms, we now show the share panel immediately when you share a project.

Finally, you can now convert an **Embed** shape to a **Bookmark** shape, and back again.

## Improvements

- We increased the allowed file size for a shared project. You can now share projects up to four times as large as before!
- We also increased the maximum number of pages in a project from 20 to 40.
- Nested submenus are now smaller, and fit better on mobile screens.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug where groups could disappear when cloned.
- Fixed an issue where shapes with a fixed aspect ratio could stretch.
- Fixed a bug where Bookmark shapes could be resized.
- Fixed a bug where Scratch Embed shapes could slide when resized as part of a group.
- Fixed icons being slightly pixelated.
- Fixed a crash that could occur while snapping.
- Fixed a bug with arrow connecting that could cause two shapes to have the same z-index.
- Fixed the pages dialog sometimes overflowing the bottom of the screen.
- On mobile, fixed an issue where the styles panel would be partially covered the actions menu.
- Fixed a crash when stretching shapes with zero width or height.
- Fixed incorrect menu label for toggling dark mode.
- Fixed the languages menu appearing in two places on desktop.
